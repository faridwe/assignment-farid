>Creating Issues: Issues are used to track tasks or bugs. You can go to the “Issues” tab and create an issue to practice organizing and tracking work.
>Adding a README: If you didn’t add one initially, you can now create a README file to describe what your repository is about.
>Branches: By default, you have a main branch. You can create a new branch to experiment with making changes without affecting the main branch.
>Pull Requests: Once you’ve made changes on a new branch, you can create a pull request to propose merging those changes back into the main branch.
>GitHub Pages or Projects: You can try setting up a project board for task tracking, or explore GitHub Pages if you want to publish content directly from your repository.
